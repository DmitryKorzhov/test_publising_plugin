Michurin Konstantin Hi all! My name is Konstantin and I\u2019m happy to join the team! A few words about myself, I have been working in IT for more than 15 years. During this time I have gone all the way from quality engineer to the head of development. I consider myself as result oriented, but at the same time, I believe that in the long distance a good result is unattainable without a solid team and reliable processes. From my work I always expect interesting and ambitious tasks and professional growth I spend my free time with family, play soccer, travel, etc.) As I have already said, I am glad to become a part of the team and achieve high results together. Vitaly Kustov Hi all!\u2003 My name is Vitaly. I\u2019ve been developing software for 12 years. I have the experience of successfully running B2B products, web, and mobile applications, and managing a team of engineers. I\u2019ve been living in Mexico since 2018.
