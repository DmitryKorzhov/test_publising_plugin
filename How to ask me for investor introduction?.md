- How to ask for VC/investor introduction 
	- double opt-out 
	- I am happy to help and forward right intros to right people. Please make my help easier with next steps.
		- Do research of investor vc and please specify with investor is a fit in blurb
		- **Send me separate forward-able email to each investor** so it will be easier for me just forward this email, instead of write many email to each person when you send me just list of investors
	 - Example 
		 - Hi Daniel,
