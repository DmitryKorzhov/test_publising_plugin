## About
- Hi all! My name is Konstantin and I'm happy to join the team! A few words about myself, I have been working in IT for more than 15 years. During this time I have gone all the way from quality engineer to the head of development. I consider myself as result oriented, but at the same time, I believe that in the long distance a good result is unattainable without a solid team and reliable processes. From my work I always expect interesting and ambitious tasks and professional growth I spend my free time with family, play soccer, travel, etc.) As I have already said, I am glad to become a part of the team and achieve high results together.
